Doc Builder is an applications to create documents sets for libraries and
applications delivered by The Retired Programmer programme.  It is used as part of
the POMs implementation so would be implicitly used by any application or library
built using the ([POMs library](https://www.theretiredprogrammer.uk/?Project=poms)).
               
**Current release**: v${project-version}

**Project Status**: works with latest POMs Library - will probably be
depreciated in Q1 2017 when an alternative documentation delivery method
will be implemented, and revised documentation creation processes and tools will
be used.
